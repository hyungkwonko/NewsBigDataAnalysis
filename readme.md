Result: Finalist

This repository includes 4 APIs made in news big data hackathon in April 2019. Teams were assigned to develop a business model to create value using news big data. We made a web service platform that shows multi-Indicator of given keyword to understand how influential it is. We made a **[demo video](https://youtu.be/NUF3Wh3QoEs)**.
