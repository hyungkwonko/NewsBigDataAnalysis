Result: Finalist

This repository includes 3 APIs made in news big data hackathon in April 2019. Teams were assigned to develop a business model to create value using news big data. We made a web service platform that shows multi-Indicator of given keyword to understand how influential it is. We made a **[demo video](https://youtu.be/NUF3Wh3QoEs)**.

### [API 01. Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/hyungkwonko/NewsBigDataAnalysis/tree/master/SentimentAnalysis)

This project was for the Linux, not xv6. Made a simple user-level command line interpreter(shell). Both Interactive mode & Batch mode are implemented in the code.

### [API 02. Related Keywords](https://github.com/hyungkwonko/NewsBigDataAnalysis/tree/master/RelatedKeywords)

By optimizing the deep learning architecture, we made a new classifying algorithm, so-called Article 2 Vector. We developed this since there are so many similar news articles on the Internet. We hoped that going through the process of Article 2 Vector would reduce the meaningless web searching time looking for the information that one had seen before. After appropriate preprocessing, it has the ability to distinguish one from another. It can work for clustering, as the similar articles have similar vectors in the higher dimension. We classified them based on the cosine similarity between them.
